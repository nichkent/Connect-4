Program:

This Program is intended to mimic the gameplay of a very popular two player game known as Connect 4. In the game,
two players take turns placing either a red or yellow piece in a column of a 6x7 grid. The first player to reach
four pieces that are next to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins!

Bugs:

Currently, there are no known bugs in this program.

The Future:

Ways that I could expand this program for the future would be to add graphics as well as alternate game modes
for increased playability.

Concepts Used:

File input and/or output: For this file I use both file input and output to save games and view saved games in
Saved_Games.txt.

I think that I have earned an B- on this project. The reason I believe this is that I have hit everything on the
rubrics except for having multiple concepts. The concepts that I missed are both inheritance which when added together
would only give me 20 points.
